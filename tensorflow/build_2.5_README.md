This documents how I built TF 2.5.

Author: Carl Lemaire

## Script

I have made a script (build_2.5.sh) with which I have succesfully build TF 2.5, for python versions 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.

This script has some depenencies:

* Get bazelisk (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk). Just download the release and rename (or symlink) it as `bazel`. Then, set `BAZEL_BIN_PATH` to the path that contains the `bazel` executable.
* Checkout the tensorflow source (at the right version, see TF docs), then set `TF_SOURCE_PATH`.
* Make sure you have the patched version of `patchelf`. I have made it available on the build node, and the path is hardcoded in the script.
* You will have to answer the questions from the `configure` step. Please refer to the "configure" section below.

It's useful to refer to the docs: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source

## Steps 

The following describes the manual steps.

You will have to repeat those steps to make a wheel for each python version. Load the corresponding python module.

### Load the Nvidia dependencies 

 module load gcc/9.3 cuda/11.0 cudnn/8 nccl/2.7

* The binaries are found in $EBROOTCUDA, $EBROOTCUDNN, etc. Use these paths in the steps below.
* Used cuda 11.0 since it was the most recent compatible with our most recent cudnn (8.0.3). Update: cudnn 8.2 has been installed, so we could use cuda 11.1 (need to use 11. for compat with cedar).
* Eventually, we might want to install a more recent tensorrt, and build with it.

### Follow instructions from TF docs 

https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source

Don't forget to create and activate a virtualenv with the required deps (e.g. numpy).

### Configure 

The answers can be found in the section "config file" below.

For most questions, use the default (press enter). However:

* For questions about python, make sure you point to your virtualenv (not cvmfs python installation)
* Build with CUDA (not by default), and refer to the following for the answers of CUDA-related questions.

I did not build with TensorRT support since we don't have a version compatible with CUDA 11.

The configure script will ask for details about the CUDA installation. I paste the following lines to answer the 5 questions:
 11
 8
 2.7
 /cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/easybuild/software/2020/Core/cudacore/11.0.2,/cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/easybuild/software/2020/CUDA/cuda11.0/cudnn/8.0.3,/cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/easybuild/software/2020/CUDA/cuda11.0/nccl/2.7.8
 3.5,3.7,6.0,7.0,7.5

Note: the last line is for compute capabilities. 3.x are for HÃ©lios.

There is one variable that the configure script does not allow to set, and has to be set manually (note that my script can set it):

The configure step produces a config file: <code>.tf_configure.bazelrc</code>

Add:
 build --action_env GCC_HOST_COMPILER_PREFIX="/cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/gentoo/2020/usr/bin"

### Patching the wheel 

NOTE: You will need to use a patched version of patchelf (built by Bart Oldeman). I have made it available here <code>/home/lemc2220/bin/patchelf</code>. It is used by <code>setrpaths.sh</code>. To use the patched version, do:

 export PATH=/home/lemc2220/bin:$PATH

Then you can patch the wheel:

 setrpaths.sh --path WHEEL.whl --add_path LIB_PATHS --any_interpreter --add_origin

Where LIB_PATHS are the CUDA_PATHS present in the configure file, but with colons, and with an added lib or lib64 at the end. Example:

 /cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/easybuild/software/2020/Core/cudacore/11.0.2/lib64:/cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/easybuild/software/2020/CUDA/cuda11.0/cudnn/8.0.3/lib64:/cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/easybuild/software/2020/CUDA/cuda11.0/nccl/2.7.8/lib64

Complete command example:

 setrpaths.sh --path tensorflow-2.5.0-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl --add_path /cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/easybuild/software/2020/Core/cudacore/11.0.2/lib64:/cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/easybuild/software/2020/CUDA/cuda11.0/cudnn/8.0.3/lib64:/cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/easybuild/software/2020/CUDA/cuda11.0/nccl/2.7.8/lib64 --any_interpreter --add_origin

## Tips

* You might want to run <code>bazel clean</code> before each build
* If when building the wheel, you get "error: invalid command 'bdist_wheel'", that means something is wrong with your .tf_configure.bazelrc. Do ./configure again, making sure to point to your virtualenv. Also make sure that the wheel named "wheel" is installed in the venv.
* I had to use a specific version of numpy, even if not mentionned in TF's install guide. I had to use numpy==1.19.2

## Config file

<code>.tf_configure.bazelrc</code>

Notes: You will have to replace the virtualenv paths.
